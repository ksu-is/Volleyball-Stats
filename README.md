# Volleyball Stats
 Application that will help coaches to keep real-time(live) stats of each individual player during matches and games

# What is our goal?
Our main goal is to efficently and effectively keep stats during game play. A lot of times the game goes to fast that you miss key events and details while tracking using a paper system. 

There are apps out there they carry out similar tasks, but they do not allow a lot of flexibility. They also don't put a lot of focus on individual skills like blocking and assists. 

We want to create a way to help you spend more time focusing on your players, while still retriving the desired stats you need for each player. We know both are extremely important and we want to make sure you have a system that allows you to have it all without the hassle and extensive time commitment. 

# Positive attributes our application will bring to your coaching!
Here are some of the attributes our app will bring to the table:
* Track each individual players' stats per set / game
* Touches on each skill set
* Easily accessible & set up is easy to understand
* Allows you to watch more of the game & give more feedback to players


Over time, we will be implementing ways to allow you to automatically feed your stats into a spreadsheet. This implementation will allow you to easily track precentages for each tournament, game day, the entire season, etc.
