# Project Map 
# Step 1
- [x] Pick a topic
- [x] View code repositorys that is similar to my topic
- [x] Pick repository or create a new on
- [x] Enter the topic on teams spreadsheet 
- [x] Join KSU-is team on Github
- [x] Fork repository to IS team on Github
- [x] Create a ReadMe.md file
- [x] Make changes and / or add comments to code

 # Step 2
- [] Edit code
- [] Update changes to main browser every other day
- [] Complete at least 6 code changes every 3 days
    - Week of 11/15
    - [] attempting to find an application that allows me to build an app or website. Was looking into Kivy, Website using flask, or Tkinter (Gui)
        - I didn't like website because I wanted something that I could potentially turn into an app that I can download onto my Ipad in the future.
        - I wasn't able to download Kivy due to some technical issues so I opted to use Tkinter to prepare an app
        - I am able to get the application running and have a logo set up
        - currently testing different ideas to see which one will work best with the ideas I have for my project 
 # Step 3 
- [] Create Powerpoint Slide 
- [] Finish editing code and making minor tweaks
